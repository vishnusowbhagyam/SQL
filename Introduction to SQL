SQL:
SQL was developed in the 1970s at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce for a project called System R, which was based on E.F. Codd’s Relational Model (1970).
SQL is a structured query language and it is mainly designed to store, manage and retrive the data in relational database management system(RDBMS). 
SQL act as a bridge between the user and database like a mediator
Before SQL:
In the early days the data was stored in a file systems and it is very hard to use or retrive the data.
To access or modify the data we need to use the complex procedual code process - They had to specify how to get data in step by step manner.
There was no standard way to interact with databases — every system had its own language and commands.
This made data management slow, error-prone, and system-dependent.

Importance of SQL in Real Times:
websites,bank systems,hospitals,universities,companies,ecommerce etc.

Features of SQL:
It is easy to learn language that means simple english keywords.
It has a data definition and Manipulation capabilities.
It has powerful querying
Data control features like control access and security.
Portable and cross platforms and high security like authentication.
Integrates with other programming languages like c,c#,c++,python,java,php,R and etc.
